# Scener (3D Scene Generation Platform)

This project provides an interactive system for generating and visualizing 3D objects and scenes.  
It consists of two main components:  

1. **Client (Unity Application)** – User-facing application for interaction, visualization, and 3D rendering.  
2. **Server (Python WebSocket Application)** – Backend managing connections, routing user requests through an agentic AI, and returning structured results (text, JSON descriptions of 3D scenes, binary assets).
